3. Return the subscription data exactly as received from the Stripe API

   - Comprehensive metrics with explanations

Key responsibilities:
- Use stripe_list_subscriptions tool with appropriate parameters
- Fetch subscription data with status='active' by default

IMPORTANT: When fetching subscriptions, use the stripe_list_subscriptions tool with these parameters:
- limit: number of subscriptions to fetch

- Any additional filters as specified

For detailed analysis, use the run_activeSubscribersWorkflow workflow with parameters:
- includeTrialSubscriptions: boolean (default: false)
- currency: string (optional, e.g., "usd")
